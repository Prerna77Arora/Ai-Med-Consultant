# ü©∫ Multimodal-Med-AI ‚Äì>> Your AI Doctor Assistant

MediBot 2.0 is an AI-powered doctor assistant that leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech, and multimodal large language models to analyze patient images and voice inputs. The system provides a simulated doctor's response both as text and synthesized speech.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **üéôÔ∏è Speech-to-Text**: Converts patient voice input to text using Whisper via Groq API.
- **üñºÔ∏è Image Analysis**: Analyzes uploaded patient images for medical concerns using a multimodal LLM (Llama-3 Vision via Groq API).
- **üîä Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI-generated responses into speech with Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- **üåê Gradio Web Interface**: User-friendly web interface for uploading images and recording voice.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MediBot2.0
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

```sh
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:

```
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_elevenlabs_api_key"
```

> **Note:** The `.env` file is already present in the repo. Update it with your own API keys.

### 4. Install System Dependencies

- **ffmpeg** and **portaudio** are required for audio processing.
- **Windows**: Download [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your PATH.
- **Linux/macOS**: Install via package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install ffmpeg portaudio19-dev`.

### 5. Run the Gradio App

```sh
pipenv run python gradio_app.py
```

The app will launch at [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860).

## üß™ How to Use


1. **Open the Gradio Web Interface**.
2. **Record your voice** using the microphone input.
3. **Upload a patient image** (e.g., a face photo).
4. **Submit** to receive:
   - The transcribed text of your speech.
   - The doctor's response based on your speech and the image.
   - The doctor's response as an audio file.

### üîç Example Interaction

#### Input

- **Voice**: "I have some redness on my cheek. Can you tell me what it is?"
- **Image**: Upload a clear photo of your face.

#### Output

- **Speech to Text**: "I have some redness on my cheek. Can you tell me what it is?"
- **Doctor's Response**: "With what I see, I think you have mild skin irritation possibly due to an allergic reaction, and keeping the area clean with gentle skincare should help."
- **Doctor's Voice**: (Audio playback of the above response)

## üìù File Descriptions

- [`gradio_app.py`](gradio_app.py): Main entry point; defines the Gradio interface and orchestrates the workflow.
- [`brain_of_the_doctor.py`](brain_of_the_doctor.py): Handles image encoding and analysis using Groq's multimodal LLM.
- [`voice_of_the_patient.py`](voice_of_the_patient.py): Handles audio recording and speech-to-text transcription.
- [`voice_of_the_doctor.py`](voice_of_the_doctor.py): Handles text-to-speech conversion and audio playback.
- [`Pipfile`](Pipfile): Lists Python dependencies.
- `.env`: Stores API keys (do not share this file publicly).

## üéõÔ∏è Customization

- **Change the system prompt** in [`gradio_app.py`](gradio_app.py) to adjust the doctor's persona or response style.
- **Switch models** by editing the model names in [`brain_of_the_doctor.py`](brain_of_the_doctor.py) and [`voice_of_the_patient.py`](voice_of_the_patient.py).

## ‚ùóTroubleshooting

- Ensure your API keys are valid and have sufficient quota.
- Make sure `ffmpeg` and `portaudio` are installed and accessible.
- If you encounter microphone or audio device errors, check your system permissions.
